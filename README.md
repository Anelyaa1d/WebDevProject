# WebDevProject
Team members: Azamat-Anel-Alua

The project is designed for our young people, so that our traditions are not forgotten and passed down from generation to generation. Since very few people now know and honor our traditions and customs. In the application, the main function is the online advisor, where anyone can find out information on the customs of getting into any situation. In addition, the main page will contain the main features of our people, in various important events in people's lives.
